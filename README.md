# Hello- Project 
This is a hello microverse project for my course in Microverse.
In this project, you will set up a "Hello world" repository. 
No complex coding is required for this exercise. 
Your goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices you learned about in previous steps. 
You will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!

## Build With
- HTML/CSS
- Linter: github actions
## General Requirements
Once you finish your project, double-check to make sure your repo is ready:

- Make sure that there are no linter errors.
- Make sure that you used correct (GitHub flow).
- Make sure that you documented your work.
## Requirements
- Remember to document your work in a professional way.
- Create a new GitHub repo.
- Create a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
- Add a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file to your project - please use this template but remember to customize it to your project.
- Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
- A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
- A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
- A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
- Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
- Open a pull request.
